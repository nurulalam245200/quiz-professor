          How does context API works?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content text-white">
          <p>
            React's component pass props by Unidirectional system but react
            context api hook provide not passing props and it can use different
            components.
            <br /> React Context is a way to manage state globally. It can be
            used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply
            nested components more easily. <br /> The Context API in React
            provides you with built-in functions and components to avoid
            prop-drilling in your component tree.
